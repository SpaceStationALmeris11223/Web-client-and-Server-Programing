<h1>Hello Vue!</h1>
{{message}} <!-- this line of code displays the message created in the create app space down below-->

<button v-on:click="addExclamationPoints"> add Exclamation Points</button> <!-- This line of code
has dual functionality it not only creates a buttton that can be clicked and add elcamation marks to the message,
but also responds to the action of clicking itself. In html these would be 2 seperarte secs of code 
so it's nice that v-on makes the process much more simple-->
<button v-on:click="clearExclamationPoints"> clear Exclamation Points</button><!--everthing that was said about the code above is true here as well.
The only difference is that instead of adding exlamation marks it removes them. More specifically it resets it back to its default value-->
